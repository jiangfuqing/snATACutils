[E::hts_open_format] Failed to open file sample1/tsseANDdepth/filtered_dedup.bam
samtools sort: can't open "sample1/tsseANDdepth/filtered_dedup.bam": No such file or directory
Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 142 of /projects/ps-renlab/yangli/scripts/snATACutils/00.data_processing/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
sample1/sample1.filtered_dedup.nsrt.bam
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job tsse2depth since they might be corrupted:
sample1/sample1.tsse2depth.ok
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
